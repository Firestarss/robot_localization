# Bags #

- Bag1:
    - This bag recorded fairly normal driving. The robot travels around most of the map and is a very good bag for testing the functionality of the code.
- Bag2:
    - This bag contains the robot spinning in place around it's spawn point and then moving to the center of the Gauntlet and spinning place some more. The point of this was to see how effective rotating would be in narrowing down the robot's position.
